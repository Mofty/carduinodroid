"CarDuinoDroid" is a creation of three components. As you can see, it consists of car, (Ar)Duino and (An)Droid. It thus combines the important parts of our former software project.

==Origin==
During our study of engineering computer science at the University of Technology in ilmenau, we had to manage a software project. With a group size of 8 people, we began our task.  About half a year we worked enthusiastically in different phases of the project. Every small step in progress was celebrated.

  * Network
  * Arduino USB communication
  * Picture sending and receiving
It was great fun. But the work goes on, in addition to studying.
