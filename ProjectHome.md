As a child, many loved to ride with an RC car through the countryside. Today it sits in front of the computer or on the other hand prefer television. How would it be to do both at the same time?

## How to start? ##

First you need an Arduino board that has a USB port. This serves as a control for your RC Car. The multifunctional center is an android enabled smartphone. This is able to make images, read GPS-data, give you Wi-Fi capability and other gimmicks.
